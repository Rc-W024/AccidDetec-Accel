# Accident Detection Based on Accelerometer

This is an accelerometer-based accident detection for electric scooters (E-Scooters) developed on the basis of anomaly event detection. I uploaded several simple detection algorithms for users to study. The basic algorithm is very important, which is of great help and reference for subsequent optimization and development. In the first file of this project, the acceleration signal is analyzed by the CFAR algorithm to detect and identify accident events. Based on this, other detection algorithms is developed that process and analyze the data and signals to detect anomaly envents (crash).

这是一个在异常事件检测的基础上开发的一种基于加速度计的电动滑板车（E-Scooters）事故检测的项目，我上传了几个简单的检测算法供用户学习。基础算法是相当重要的，它对算法后续的优化、开发有很大的帮助和参考意义。在该项目的第一个文件中，通过CFAR算法分析加速度信号以检测识别事故事件。在此基础上，开发的其他检测算法都是通过处理、分析数据和信号本身来检测异常（事故）事件。

CFAR算法的基本原理和框架可以参考我的SAR船舶检测项目，或者参考Matlab网站的介绍。

For the basic principles and framework of the CFAR algorithm, you can refer to my project of [SAR ship detection](https://github.com/Rc-W024/SAR_Ship_detection_CFAR), or refer to the following web site: [Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) Detection](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/phased/ug/constant-false-alarm-rate-cfar-detection.html)
